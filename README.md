# Bellabeat Case Study — Fitbit Wellness Data Analysis

This project is a Google Data Analytics Capstone and demonstrates skills in data cleaning, visualization, segmentation, and narrative storytelling. The goal is to understand user activity, sleep behavior, and circadian movement patterns and includes a rigorous, data‑driven analytical workflow featuring:

- Statistical diagnostics (skewness, outlier detection, distribution analysis)  
- Correlation analysis and MET‑weighted intensity scoring  
- Clustering and persona segmentation using K‑Means  
- Circadian rhythm and hourly activity modeling
- Sleep pattern evaluation (duration, efficiency, timing)  
- Integrated behavioral interpretation grounded in quantitative evidence  

The aim is to provide a methodologically sound, reproducible, and insight‑rich analysis rather than a simple narrative description of the data.
